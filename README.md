## 📕 Installation


First of all, download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and your favourite IDE (I used [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=windows)). Python Version `3.6` or higher is required.
<br>

### 🕷️ Create an environment

Whatever you prefer (e.g. `conda` or `venv`)

```console
mkdir myproject
$ cd myproject
$ python3 -m venv venv
```

### 🕷️ Activate the venv folder

Windows:

```console
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Mac / Linux (Create a venv, activate it and install requirements.txt):

```console
. python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate
```

### 🕷️ Install Dependencies

Install Dependencies only for Mac/Linux:

 ```console
. pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

<br>

### 💻 Run Project

Start [main.py](main.py).

```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a window named `RPS Game` as follows:

Press `s` in your keyboard to `start the game`. Use rock, paper, scissors gestures to play with the AI and enjoy.

I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this project, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
